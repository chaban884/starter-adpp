# starter-adpp
This starter kit is composed of Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with ConnectKit, ethers, & wagmi for all your web3 needs. It uses Typescript and an opinionated directory structure for maximum dev confy-ness.

# Getting Started
First, install dependencies with yarn install. Then, initialize the env file with cp .env.example .env, and add your Infura project id. Finally, run the development server with yarn dev.
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.
The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
